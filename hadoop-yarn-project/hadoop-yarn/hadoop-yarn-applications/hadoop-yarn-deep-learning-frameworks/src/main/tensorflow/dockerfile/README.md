# Creating Docker Images for Running Tensorflow on YARN 

## How to create docker images to run Tensorflow on YARN

Dockerfile to run Tensorflow on YARN need two part: 

**Base libraries which Tensorflow depends on**
1) OS base image, for example ```ubuntu:16.04```
2) Tensorflow depended libraries and packages. For example ```python```, ```scipy```. For GPU support, need ```cuda```, ```cudnn```, etc.
3) Tensorflow package.

**Libraries to access HDFS**
1) JDK
2) Hadoop

Here's an example of a base image (w/o GPU support) to install Tensorflow:
```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

# Pick up some TF dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        build-essential \
        curl \
        libfreetype6-dev \
        libpng12-dev \
        libzmq3-dev \
        pkg-config \
        python \
        python-dev \
        rsync \
        software-properties-common \
        unzip \
        && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && \
    python get-pip.py && \
    rm get-pip.py

RUN pip --no-cache-dir install \
        Pillow \
        h5py \
        ipykernel \
        jupyter \
        matplotlib \
        numpy \
        pandas \
        scipy \
        sklearn \
        && \
    python -m ipykernel.kernelspec

RUN pip --no-cache-dir install \
    http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

On top of above image, add files, install packages to access HDFS
```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk wget
RUN wget http://apache.cs.utah.edu/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.1.0/hadoop-3.1.0.tar.gz
RUN tar zxf hadoop-3.1.0.tar.gz

# hadoop-conf should include core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml
ADD hadoop-conf /etc/hadoop/conf/

# mount etc/passwd to properly use users.
ADD etc/passwd /etc/passwd

# mount krb5.conf to access Kerberorized-HDFS
ADD krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf
```

Build and push to your own docker registry: Use ```docker build ... ``` and ```docker push ...``` to finish this step.

## Use examples to build your own Tensorflow docker images

We provided following examples for you to build tensorflow docker images.
 
- *base/ubuntu-16.04/Dockerfile.cpu.tf_1.3.0*: Tensorflow 1.3.0 supports CPU only.
- *with-models/ubuntu-16.04/Dockerfile.cpu.tf_1.3.0*: Tensorflow 1.3.0 supports CPU only, and included models
- *base/ubuntu-16.04/Dockerfile.gpu.cuda_8.0.tf_1.3.0*: Tensorflow 1.3.0 supports GPU, which is prebuilt to CUDA8.
- *with-models/ubuntu-16.04/Dockerfile.gpu.cuda_8.0.tf_1.3.0*: Tensorflow 1.3.0 supports GPU, which is prebuilt to CUDA8, with models.
